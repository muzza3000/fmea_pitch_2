					For the last 10 years or so I have been working as a mechanical engineer in product design.
					(------)
					When you start to design something, the first thing you need to know is what is it meant to do, i.e. what "functions" is it meant to perform.
					(------)
					Then, in order to ensure you create a robust and successful design, you need to try and think of every possible way the design may fail, or fail to perform it's intended functions. We call these "failure modes"
					(------)
					Let's say for example that I am design a mountain bike. The first thing I would want to do, is define the functions it must perform.

					We then dive a level deeper where we want to define all the potential causes for this failure mode, and the effect that they would have on the overall success of the product...
					(....)
					We always do this as a team, to leverage the collective experience of product experts, so that we capture as many of the causes and corresponding effects as possible
					(....)
					So for example in this case, one potential cause may be that the current brake discs only provide a moderate amount of braking force, and the effect of this would be that the the customer is mildly dissatisfied, we receive some bad reviews and loss in sales.
					(....)
					Once we have a list of potential causes and effects, we go on to assess the likelihood that this cause may occur, and the severity of the outcome.

				<p>So we set out to change that</p>
				<div class="d-flex space-between">

				<aside class="notes">
					So we setout to change this by creating a truly collaborative experience that facilitates these vital brainstorming sessions.

					(....)

					So when you open our tool FMEA.lite, you are greeted with a landing page explaining that we try to help foresee future design problems using collective past experience.

					We point out that users are able to collaborate in the cloud and that we generate documentation automatically at the click of a button.

					(....)
					We now log in and land on the FMEA dashboard page.

					Here the user can see a list of all their team's FMEAs, their title, the risk matrix, a summary of the key statistics and some actions they can perform, like share direct links, download and delete.

					Our user might search "mountain" for the mountain bike, and simply clicks to open.

					(....)

					They are then greeted with main FMEA page, containing a tree structure of all the functions, fms, causes and effects.

					There is a description of the product in the header, and an image carousel containing product images and useful engineering diagrams to facilitate the process. Which can be opened to see all the details.


					As we scroll down the page, the user can interact with the tree, and the view will dynamically focus on the item and it's children. Also the actions menu will automatically display the available actions based on the selected item.

					To maximise the working, space, the product header, auto collapses.

					(....)
					We can see that the last function is our familiar example, that the bike must be able to slow down.

					The user can now add a failure mode by selecting the function, and clicking add failure mode from the action menu.

					>>>>> FM
					Brakes totally fail during a downhill descent


					Now that the setup is done, we can launch the collaboration mode

					(....)

					This environment was designed specifically to facilitate collaborative meetings, allowing all participants, to share their ideas and insight in real time to a common screen.

					The functions and corresponding failure mode can be navigated using the selector at the top of the screen.

					And a link can be easily shared to colleagues to get everybody to the same place.

					When a user adds their potential cause or effect, it will be seen on everybody's screen instantaneously.

					So let's do an example.
					Here I am adding my own cause suggestions, for example

					Customer forgets to adjust brakes after removing and reinstalling the front wheel
					3 +

					Brake fluid pressure is lost due to a failing mechanical component
					2 +

					Brake lever shakes loose after extended operation
					2

					>>>>>
					while other people are adding effects:

					Rider is badly injured
					5 +

					Customer trust is lost and brand image damaged for many years
					4

					Now as a team we can discuss the suggestions, provide an assessment of the severity and the occurrence and decide or not whether to include them in the final assessment.

					(....)

					We now navigate back to the mountain bike FMEA overview, and we can see out newly added causes and effects were added to the tree.

					After a final review we decide to scroll back to the top of the page and download the document to excel.

					As documentation is so important in product design, both for archives and sometimes to abide by various iso standards, we believe the ability to export at the click of a button provides a great selling point to our end users.

					(....)

					After completing my work, I can navigate back to the dashboard, where I notice that the statistics reflect the latest changes, and I can browse back to the home page.

					From Benjamin and myself, we'd like to thank you for your time and if there are any budding product designers or engineers out there, who wish to give our tool a spin, please sign up today to begin creating your FMEAs.
